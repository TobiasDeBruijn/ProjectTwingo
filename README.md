# Project Twingo
I own a Renault Twingo Initiale from 2002. This car originally shipped with a simple FM radio, that wasn't enough.

## Goals
With this project I'm trying to do the following:
- Add Android Auto to the Twingo, both wireless and via USB
    - Retain the steering wheel controls
- Interior lighting
    - Replace ceiling light with LED
    - Feet of front passengers
- Replace the standard display in the middle of the dashboard? (Mine is sortof broken)
- Control AC electronically with a thermostat?
